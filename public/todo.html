        <td>Tomato edit: redo the whole edit thing. First, when you click the link to the tomato you should go to the noneditable view screen. There should be an Edit. That is how user gets to the editable page. On the Edit view the category should be the preselected in a select form element. The keywords with be a list of 
        checkboxes with the currently used keywords already select. If the user decide to chose a completely different category, then the keywords available for that category should show. Somehow, the originally selected keywords should still be there if the user decides to go back to his original category.
